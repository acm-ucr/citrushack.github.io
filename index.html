                <h4>What is a hackathon?</h4>
                <p>A hackathon is a place where the only thing limiting what you build is your own creativity. Stay up for 48 hours with the smartest people you'll ever meet, building the coolest things you have created and chugging more Red Bull than you ever thought possible. Check out this blog postby Dave Fontenot, which tells you what to expect.</p>
                
                <h4>What should I create?</h4>
                <p>You can build whatever you want: websites, apps, or hardware (no soldering allowed). All code must be written during the hackathon - feel free to use open source libraries and APIs. Hacks are judged on creativity, technical difficulty, usefulness, and overall awesomeness.</p>
                
                <h4>How does reimbursement work?</h4>
                <p>At the event, we will distribute reimbursement forms to individuals selected for $200 reimbursements. Following the event, we will do a direct transfer to your account.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h4>I live in Northern California. How do I get to the event?</h4>
                <p>We will provide buses free of charge to the first 500 applicants from Northern California that say they need a bus on their registration. You can catch our buses at Berkeley or Stanford at 3:00pm on Friday, January 24th. We'll drop you off at Stanford or Berkeley at 10:00pm on Sunday. More details to come.</p>
                
                <h4>What other rules should I be aware of?</h4>
                <p>We're glad you asked! Alcohol is forbidden. Also, no soldering irons, open flames, or anything else you couldn't safely use in a stadium ( ask us if in doubt). No weapons, firearms, etc.</p>
                
                <h4>How are hacks presented?</h4>
                <p>On Sunday at 12:00pm, all hackers will be able to demo their hacks to sponsors and their fellow hackers. Fifteen hacks will be selected based on submitted videos, and these teams/individuals will present their hacks to everyone for two minutes.</p>
