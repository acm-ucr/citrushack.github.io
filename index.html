        <div class="row marketing">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h4>What is a hackathon?</h4>
                <p>A hackathon is a place where the only thing limiting what you build is your own creativity. Stay up for 42 hours with the smartest people you'll ever meet, building the coolest things you have created and chugging more Red Bull than you ever thought possible. </p>
                
                <h4>What should I create?</h4>
                <p>You can build whatever you want: websites, apps, or hardware (no soldering allowed). All code must be written during the hackathon - feel free to use open source libraries and APIs. Hacks are judged on creativity, technical difficulty, usefulness, and overall awesomeness.</p>
                
                <h4>Who can come?</h4>
                <p>Undergraduate or graduate students. We may also admit high school students but please notify us and you will be accepted on a case-by-case basis. We encourage students of all disciplines to come.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <h4>Do I need to have a team?</h4>
                <p>Nope! Just come by at the start of the event and you'll find tons of great people to form a team with. You are of course welcome to sign up as a team if you already have a few people in mind. We'd like to limit the teams to no more than 6 per team. You are also welcome to compete as an individual.</p>
                
                <h4>What other rules should I be aware of?</h4>
                <p>We're glad you asked! Alcohol is forbidden. Also, no soldering irons, open flames, or anything else you couldn't safely use in a stadium ( ask us if in doubt). No weapons, firearms, etc.</p>
                
                <h4>How are hacks presented?</h4>
                <p>On Sunday at 12:00pm, all hackers will be able to demo their hacks to sponsors and their fellow hackers. Fifteen hacks will be selected based on submitted videos, and these teams/individuals will present their hacks to everyone for two minutes.</p>
